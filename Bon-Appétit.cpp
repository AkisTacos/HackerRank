/* Description:
	MAnna and Brian are sharing a meal at a restuarant and they agree to split the bill equally. 
	Brian wants to order something that Anna is allergic to though, and they agree that Anna won't pay for that item. 
	Brian gets the check and calculates Anna's portion. You must determine if his calculation is correct.
	For example, assume the bill has the following prices: bill = [2, 4, 6]. 
	Anna declines to eat item k = bill[2] which costs 6. If Brian calculates the bill correctly, Anna will pay (2 + 4)/2 = 3. 
	If he includes the cost of bill[2], he will calculate (2 + 4+ 6)/2 = 6. In the second case, he should refund 3 to Anna.
	You are given an array of prices, bill, the cost of each of the n items, k, the item Anna doesn't eat,
	and b, the total amount of money that Brian charged Anna for her portion of the bill. 
	If the bill is fairly split, print Bon Appetit. Otherwise, print the integer amount of money that Brian must refund to Anna.
